    <h2>Why is all of this required??</h2>
    <p>Microsoft has a very weird and complicated way of compiling UWP apps, and for some reason, I cannot make any release applications due to... well... Microsoft being weird. I'll try to compile it as a release app in a future update, but there's only like 8 days until he gets his mi 11 anyways so yeah idk if its necessary ðŸ’€</p>
    <p class="small-text">This app isn't even meant to be that advanced and amazing, it's mostly just some weird project I'm working on so I probably won't even bother updating this.</p>
